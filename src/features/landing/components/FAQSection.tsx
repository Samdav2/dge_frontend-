        q: "How does the Escrow payment system work?",
        a: "When you hire a professional on DGE World, your payment is held securely in Escrow — not with the service provider. The funds are only released to them after you confirm that the work has been completed to your satisfaction. If there is a dispute, our team steps in to mediate fairly.",
    },
    {
        q: "How do I find and hire a service provider?",
        a: "Simply search for the service you need, browse verified providers or post a job, and use our built-in negotiation system to agree on a fair price. Once you are happy, confirm the booking and the Escrow is created automatically.",
    },
    {
        q: "Are the professionals on DGE World verified?",
        a: "Yes. Every service provider on DGE World goes through a thorough background check and KYC (Know Your Customer) verification before they can offer services. You can also see their community ratings and client reviews before hiring.",
    },
    {
        q: "What happens if I am not satisfied with the completed work?",
        a: "Your payment is fully protected. If the work does not meet your expectations, you can request revisions or open a dispute. Our team will review the case and ensure a fair resolution. We hold the Escrow funds until the matter is resolved.",
    },
    {
        q: "How does DGE Rides work?",
        a: "DGE Rides is our built-in ride-hailing service. Simply open the app, enter your destination, and we will match you with a nearby verified driver. You can track your ride in real time, and payment is handled seamlessly through your DGE World wallet.",
    },
    {
        q: "How do I withdraw my earnings as a freelancer or driver?",
        a: "Your earnings go directly into your DGE World Earnings Wallet after each completed job or ride. You can request a withdrawal to your verified bank account at any time, and payments are processed promptly.",
    },
